<h1>About this Blog</h1>

<p>I've always enjoyed hiking and the outdoors, though I wouldn't consider myself a serious hiker. The idea of climbing all of New Hampshire's
four-thousand footers seemed like a neat goal, but I'm not really an ambitious enough mountaineer to give it a real try. My dog loves hiking as well and
is very intrepid. My wife, who may occasionally appear in this blog, is decidedly not an outdoorswoman, and considerably less intrepid than 
the dog. But she is very ambitious, and when presented with the challenge was suprisingly very into it. So we decided to give it a go. 
We'll be doing some warm up hikes, and then we'll dive right in. It will be a learning process for all of us, and my biggest concern is
doing it safely. The White Mountains can be dangerous, and I care immensely about the well-being of both my dog and my wife. As such there
will likely be some hikes the pup will sit out, either due to length or difficulty. But my goal is to bring both of them on as many as I can. </p>

<h1>About this Dog</h1>

<p>This cutie is named Lana. She is a Goldendoodle, and at the start of this journey she is about 2.5 years old and still full of puppy energy.
She loves being outside and is very well behaved on the trails. She is, as I said, quite intrepid, and more than willing to scramble up 
boulders and wade through streams. When she was a pup we lived in Plymouth, NH and I took her out in the woods and mountains from an early age.
I'm always impressed by her ability to follow the trails and her trust in me to pick out the best path when she in unsure.</p>
